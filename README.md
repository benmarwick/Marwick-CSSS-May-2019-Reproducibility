# Reproducible Research at the University College London, March 2019: Workshop and Presentation 

This repository contains two of the presentations on reproducible research and open science that I gave at the University College London in March 2019. 

**First**, I presented a workshop on using the [rrtools](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) package to easily make reproducble manuscripts: "Rapid On-ramps to Reproducible Research for R Users" ([slides]((https://benmarwick.github.io/Marwick-UCL-March-2019-Reproducibility-Workshop#1))

This was a hands-on activity, with the participants given these instructions in advance: 

1. Bring a laptop and power supply so you can charge the battery during the day     

2. Before coming to the workshop download and install onto your laptop these *three* free programs (accepting all default options during installation, even if you have previously installed these in the past, please update them now, we need the latest versions):

a. R for Windows (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) or OSX (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg)

b. RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

c. Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads

3. Create a free account for yourself on http://github.com, this is useful for working with the Git version control system

4. If you have any questions before the workshop, please send an email to me at bmarwick@uw.edu

**Second**, I gave a presentation in the ['Seminar on Reproducibility and Open Research'](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~phys1213/ReproAtASC.html) series at All Souls College, organised by [Lisa Lodwick](https://twitter.com/LisaLodwick) and [Jasmine Nirody](https://twitter.com/jasnir_): 

"Four ordered principles to improve the reproducibility of research" ([slides](https://benmarwick.github.io/Marwick-Oxford-Nov-2018-Reproducibility/Marwick-UCL-Mar-2019-Reproducibility-Seminar.html#1))

"Long considered an axiom of science, the reproducibility of scientific research has recently come under scrutiny after some highly-publicized failures to reproduce results. This has often been linked to the failure of the current model of journal publishing to provide enough details for reviewers to adequately assess the correctness of papers submitted for publication. One early proposal for ameliorating this situation is to bundle the different files that make up a research result into a 'compendium'. At the time it was originally proposed, creating a compendium was a complex process. In this talk I describe four generic principles to guide the creation of a compendium, suitable for more fields of research. I show how modern software tools and services have substantially lightened the burden of making compendia. I describe current approaches to making these compendia to accompany journal articles. Several recent projects of varying sizes are briefly presented to show how my colleagues and I are using R and related tools (e.g. version control, continuous integration, containers, repositories) to make compendia for our publications. I explain how these approaches, which we believe to be widely applicable to many types of research work, subvert the constraints of the typical journal article, and improve the efficiency and reproducibility of our research."
